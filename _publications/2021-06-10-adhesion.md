**Abstract:**
This monograph considers the mathematical modeling of cellular adhesion, a key interaction force in
cell biology. While deeply grounded in the biological application of cell adhesion and tissue
formation, this monograph focuses on the mathematical analysis of non-local adhesion models. The
novel aspect is the non-local term (an integral operator), which accounts for forces generated by
long ranged cell interactions. The analysis of non-local models has started only recently, and it
has become a vibrant area of applied mathematics. This monograph contributes a systematic analysis
of steady states and their bifurcation structure, combining global bifurcation results pioneered by
Rabinowitz, equivariant bifurcation theory, and the symmetries of the non-local term. These methods
allow readers to analyze and understand cell adhesion on a deep level.
